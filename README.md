# Introduction

While there are already AngelScript Language Server extensions available for VSCode, many of them are platform-specific.
For example, there are excellent Language Servers specialized for specific environments like
[Unreal Angelscript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Hazelight.unreal-angelscript) and
[Openplanet Angelscript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=XertroV.openplanet-angelscript).
Developers working in these environments are encouraged to use those options.

However, if you are looking for a general-purpose Language Server that is not dependent on a particular application, this extension might be useful for you.
This extension aims to serve as a universal Language Server, independent of any specific application that integrates AngelScript.


# Features

The Language Server analyzes AngelScript files within your project and offers the following features:

- Syntax Highlighting for AngelScript
- Autocompletion
- Type Checking
- Go to Definition
- Find References
- Symbol Renaming
- Snippets
- Code Actions
- Formatter
- Debugger

> Note: As this project is still under development, there may be bugs or incomplete support for some of these features. Future updates will continue to improve functionality.


# Getting Started

1. Install this extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

1. Create a file named `as.predefined` in the root directory of your AngelScript project.

   `as.predefined` is a custom file used by this Language Server.

1. In `as.predefined`, define your applicationâ€™s types and functions using AngelScript syntax.

   When analyzing `*.as` files, this Language Server implicitly imports symbols defined in `as.predefined`.

   This allows the Language Server to recognize the custom types and functions defined by your application, enabling autocompletion and type checking.

   You can check actual examples of `as.predefined` below:

    - [OpenSiv3D/as.predefined](./examples/OpenSiv3D/as.predefined) for [OpenSiv3D](https://github.com/Siv3D/OpenSiv3D) (v0.6)

    - [Sven Co-op/as.predefined](./examples/Sven%20Co-op/as.predefined) for [Sven Co-op](https://store.steampowered.com/app/225840/Sven_Coop) by [@DrAbcOfficial](https://github.com/DrAbcOfficial)

   In many cases, `as.predefined` can also be automatically generated.

   - [Example of generate `as.predefined` in C++](./examples/generate_as_predefined.cpp)

> Note: Documentation for the Debugger, Code Actions, and other features is currently missing and will be added in a future update.

# Unimplemented Features

The following features are currently under development:

- Detailed AngelScript features: Support for `import` is still incomplete.
- Enhanced Type Checking: Current support for handlers and const is limited.


# Other Clients

It's still in development, but there are implementations for clients other than VSCode as well.

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sashi0034/angel-lsp/issues) .

If you fix a small bug or add an enhancement, feel free to submit a pull request.

Additionally, if you create an `as.predefined` file for your application, contributing it as an example would be greatly appreciated and could be helpful to others.
